# Additions and Subtraction Elements

For the Supplemental Poverty Measure, the US Census have factored in key elements that supposedly influence the increase/decrease in the number of people in poverty. These elements are divided into 2 categories: 
* Addition Elements
* Subtraction Elements

### Addition Elements

Addition Elements are factors that **increase the resource** of a family or single individual (i.e *put additional money to the available resource*), thus **decrease the number of people in poverty.**

### Subtraction Elements

Subtraction Elements are factors that **decrease the resouce** of a family or single individual (i.e *subtract money from the available resource*), thus **decrease the number of people in poverty.**
